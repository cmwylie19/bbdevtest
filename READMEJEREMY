*side note- I have taken another job offer
but i thought this project was super cool
 and fun.


1. Fork -> Sorry i have really bad internet and
had to work from a coffee shop. When I uploaded
codepin the code looked very different and being
short on time i uploaded to firebase instead.

2. Responsive -> Responsiveness and what looks
good is always opinionated, to me it looks good.
I could have wrote some media queries for a medium
sized tablet but i dont think it was a requirement.
